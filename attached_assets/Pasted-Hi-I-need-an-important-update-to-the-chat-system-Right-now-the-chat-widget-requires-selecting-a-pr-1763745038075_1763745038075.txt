Hi, I need an important update to the chat system.
Right now the chat widget requires selecting a project, but I want a unified inbox system like Intercom/Crisp.

🔧 New Requirement: Unified Developer Inbox (No Project Selection Needed)

Please remove the project dropdown from the chat widget.
I want the chat to work like this:

✔ 1. Developer or Admin will NOT select any project manually.

When a developer logs in, the chat widget should automatically load all conversations from all projects assigned to that developer.

✔ 2. All messages should appear in one unified chat inbox.

Example: If developer Monsur is assigned to two projects:

Client A → Project 1

Client B → Project 2

Then the chat widget should show all incoming messages together (like Intercom inbox).

✔ 3. Each message must show:

Client Name

Project Name

Message text

Timestamp

This way developer can easily see who sent the message.

✔ 4. When developer replies:

The system must automatically route the reply based on the message’s:

client_id

project_id

Developer will NOT choose anything manually.
The reply must go directly to the correct client.

✔ 5. Backend should auto-detect the routing:

When developer sends reply:

find the conversation’s project_id

find the conversation’s client_id

store reply under that project

trigger websocket to that client
So the developer only types a message — no dropdown, no selection.

✔ 6. Client-side:

Clients will only see messages related to their own project (as usual).

✔ 7. Purpose:

This makes the chat act like Intercom-style “Unified Developer Inbox,” where all assigned project messages appear together automatically.

🔍 In short:

❌ No project dropdown in chat widget

✅ One unified inbox for developer

✔ Auto-routing based on message metadata

✔ Show project & client info inside each message

✔ Unified messaging experience like Intercom/Zendesk

Please update the chat widget + backend routing accordingly.

Let me know when it’s done.

If you want Farid, I can also prepare:

✅ database model changes
✅ API endpoint logic
✅ exact code structure (React + WebSocket + Node/Express)

Just tell me.
