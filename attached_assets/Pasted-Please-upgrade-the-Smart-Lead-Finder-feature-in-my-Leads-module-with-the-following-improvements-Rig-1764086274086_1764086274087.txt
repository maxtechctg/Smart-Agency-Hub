Please upgrade the Smart Lead Finder feature in my Leads module with the following improvements. Right now it only shows 9 results; I want it to be a powerful lead–hunting tool.

1. Fetch more results from SerpAPI

In the backend SerpAPI call for Smart Lead Finder:

Increase num from the default (10) to 30 or 50.

Add pagination support using start (or SerpAPI’s page / next_page_token if available).

The API should accept page or cursor from the frontend and return:

results (array)

total_results if available

page, hasMore (true/false)

2. Smarter filtering (don’t limit to only 9)

Currently it looks like you filter very aggressively (must have email + phone + website).

Please change the rule to:

Include any business that has at least one of: email, phone, or website.

Mark missing fields in the UI (e.g. show “—” or grey text).

This alone will increase the number of visible rows a lot.

3. Combine multiple SerpAPI sources

For each search:

Use google engine with Local results (Maps / local_pack).

Optionally also use google_maps or google_local engine if that gives richer business data.

Merge the results, deduplicate by domain / business name.

Extract these fields per business if available:

name

category / type

phone

email (if SerpAPI returns it)

website

rating / reviews

address / location

4. Frontend – better UI in the Smart Lead Finder dialog

At the top of the modal, show:

X results found, showing 1–30, and total if we know it.

Add a “Load More” button at the bottom:

When clicked, call the backend with page + 1 and append rows.

Keep the existing checkbox selection and “Import Selected” behavior.

For each row, show:

Business Name

Contact (email / phone – even if only one is available)

Website (clickable link)

Rating (if available)

Category / Source (e.g. “Google Local”, “Organic”)

5. Import logic – category & duplicate handling

When user clicks Import Selected:

Create leads in the existing leads table using:

name → lead name

email → lead email

phone → lead phone

website → lead website

source → set to "Smart Lead Finder"

category → either:

auto–mapped from business type (IT, Marketing, Real Estate, etc.), or

ask the user to choose a category once for the whole import (simple dropdown).

Avoid duplicates:

If a lead with same email or website already exists, skip it and show it in a “Skipped (duplicate)” list in the result summary.

6. Optional enhancements (if time allows)

Add location field support properly:

If user enters Location, pass it to SerpAPI’s location / uule parameter so that results are more accurate.

Add saved search presets:

Example: “Real Estate in Dhaka”, “Pharmacy in Chattogram”, etc.

Log Smart Lead Finder imports in a separate table (e.g. lead_imports) for analytics.

Expected outcome

After this upgrade I should be able to:

Search e.g. “IT companies in Dhaka” and get dozens of businesses, not just 9.

Scroll / click “Load More” to see additional pages.

Select many businesses and import them to Leads with one click.

See them categorized and without duplicates inside my existing Leads module.

Please implement this full upgrade without changing other modules, and keep the UI consistent with the current design.
