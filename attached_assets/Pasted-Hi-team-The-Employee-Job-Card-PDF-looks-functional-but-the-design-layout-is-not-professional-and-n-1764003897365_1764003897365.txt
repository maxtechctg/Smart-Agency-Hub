Hi team,
The Employee Job Card PDF looks functional, but the design/layout is not professional and needs correction. Here are the issues I am facing:

🔴 Current Problems

Header section overlapping

Company details and “Employee Job Card” block collide

The generated date/time also overlaps or breaks layout

No proper alignment or spacing

No clean professional structure

Header, body and table spacing inconsistent

Typography and color hierarchy not corporate level

The right-side header block looks random and not formatted

Company Branding Missing / Weak

Company logo missing

Company header not aligned centrally

Should look like a standard corporate HR report

PDF not following standard HR Report guidelines

No box-style header

No section dividers

Title section should be bold + centered

Summary cards alignment could be more polished

🟢 What I Need You to Do

Please redesign the entire Employee Job Card PDF to make it look like a professional, standard HR document:

✔ Required Design Updates

Add company logo on top-left

Add company name + address centered under the logo

Move “Employee Job Card” block to top-right inside a neat box

Proper spacing around the header (top margin 20–30px)

Use a clean grid for Attendance Summary

Align all summary boxes evenly

Add professional borders + grey background where needed

Make the date range + generated date appear clean and aligned

Fix spacing between sections (header → employee info → summary → table)

Add subtle line separators

Use consistent text size (e.g., 12px body, 14px labels, 18px titles)

✔ Example Corporate Layout I Want

Top Section:
Logo (left) — Company Info (center) — Job Card Info (right)

Employee Info Box:
Full-width light grey box with padding

Summary Cards:
Evenly spaced 6 cards with light border + colored numbers

Attendance Table:
Proper lines, alternating row shading, clean fonts

Footer:
Center: “MaxTech BD | Smart Agency Control Hub”
Below: “Developed by MaxTech BD IT Team”

🟢 Goal

I want the job card to look fully professional, clean, aligned, and suitable for HR documentation, client submission, and employee records.

Please fix the layout and styling accordingly.

Thanks.
Farid
