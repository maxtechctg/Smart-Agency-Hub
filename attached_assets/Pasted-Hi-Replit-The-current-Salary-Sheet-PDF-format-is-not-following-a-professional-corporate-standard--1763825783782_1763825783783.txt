Hi Replit,

The current Salary Sheet PDF format is not following a professional corporate standard. I need this to be fully redesigned with a clean, modern layout that matches official HR/payroll documents.

🔧 Issues in the current format

Layout spacing inconsistent

Table header alignment broken

Fonts are too basic

Branding not properly structured

Summary section spacing unbalanced

Signature lines misaligned

Table columns look stretched and not uniform

No border or proper separation between sections

🛠️ What I want Replit to fix

Please redesign the Salary Sheet PDF into a standard HR-compliant format, similar to corporate payroll documents.
The design should include:

Brand Header (Top Section)

My company logo (already provided)

Company Name: MaxTech BD

Address: 522, SK Mujib Road (4th Floor), Agrabad, Double Mooring, Chattogram, Bangladesh

Phone: +8801843180008

Email: info@maxtechbd.com

Report Header

Title: Salary Sheet

Period: Month + Year

Generated Date & Time

Consistent spacing and alignment

Summary Box (Better Design)

Total Employees

Total Basic Salary

Total Allowances

Total Deductions

Total Overtime

Total Net Payable

➡️ All values must be neatly aligned in a 2-column or 3-column grid.

Main Table

A clean, bordered, professionally padded table with:

Employee Name

Employee ID

Department

Designation

Basic Salary

Allowances

Deductions

Overtime

Net Salary

Status

➡️ Columns must be aligned, evenly spaced, and readable.

Footer

Three signature lines:

Prepared By

Verified By

Approved By

Company footer text (small size, center aligned)

📌 Additional Requirements

Use consistent fonts (Roboto, Open Sans or similar)

Proper padding/margins

Modern table styling with subtle borders

Keep branding color #E11D26

Ensure BDT formatting everywhere (comma + decimal)

Ensure landscape layout is balanced

📌 Summary

👉 Please redesign the Salary Sheet PDF layout completely using a professional HR/payroll formatting standard.
👉 Keep full MaxTech BD branding.
👉 Ensure spacing, layout, table, footer, and summary look polished.

Thank you!
