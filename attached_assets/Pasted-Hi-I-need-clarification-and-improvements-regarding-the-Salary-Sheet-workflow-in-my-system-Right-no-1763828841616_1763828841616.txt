Hi, I need clarification and improvements regarding the Salary Sheet workflow in my system.
Right now, the Salary Sheet only shows basic salary and allowances, but it does not follow real-life HR/Payroll logic.

❗ I need you to explain what is the actual expected behaviour and then implement it.
❌ Current Issues

The system does NOT generate actual salary based on employee attendance.

Late days, absents, and overtime do NOT affect salary.

There is no “Salary Generate / Process Month” option.

No option for manual attendance override (in case admin wants to correct attendance).

The Salary Sheet only displays data but does not calculate salary based on rules.

✅ What the Salary Module SHOULD DO (Actual Behaviour Needed)
1. Salary must be generated from attendance

For every month:

Absent days = salary deduction

Late 3 days = 1 absent (Standard HR rule)

Overtime hours = extra pay

Half day = 0.5 salary deduction

2. Automatic Salary Calculation Formula

Admin should be able to generate salary using:

Basic Salary = Monthly Salary  
Daily Rate = Basic Salary / 30  

Absent Deduction = Daily Rate × Absent Days  
Late Deduction = Daily Rate × (LateDays / 3)  
Net Salary = Basic Salary + Allowances - (Absent + Late + Other deductions)

3. Manual Attendance Input

Admin must get an option:

➡️ Add Manual Attendance
➡️ Add Adjustments (Bonus, Penalty, Deduction)
➡️ These must affect final salary calculation.

4. Actual Salary Generation Flow (Needed)

Select Month / Year

Load attendance for all employees

Apply salary structure (basic, house rent, transport etc.)

Apply attendance rules

Apply manual adjustments (if any)

Generate Salary

Mark payment status (Generated / Paid)

✅ What I need you to build now

Add Salary Processing Button
→ “Generate Salary for Selected Month”

Calculate Salary Based on Attendance
→ Late
→ Absent
→ Overtime
→ Manual attendance input

Salary Sheet must show full HR details:

Present Days

Absent Days

Late Days

Overtime Hours

Deductions

Final Payable Salary

Payment Status (Generated / Paid)

Attendance → Salary Integration
Everything should be fully synced.

⚠️ Why this is important

Right now the Salary Sheet PDF is designed beautifully,
but the salary logic is not real HR logic,
so it cannot be used for a real company.

I need the complete salary processing system,
not just a display.

If you need any sample HR rules or formulas, let me know.
Please update the module according to these requirements.
