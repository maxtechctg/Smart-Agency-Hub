Hi Replit 👋
I want to build a complete Smart Agency Control Hub System for my company MaxTech BD, and also make the architecture flexible so that later it can work as a multi-tenant SaaS platform.

🚀 Project Goal

A complete all-in-one platform where our agency can manage:

Leads & CRM

Clients

Projects & Tasks

Team Communication

File Management

Staff Attendance

Accounts, Income & Expenses

Invoices & Payments

Dashboard KPIs

Notifications

Audit Logs

Later this system should support multiple agencies under separate subdomains (multi-tenant).

🧱 Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind
Backend: Node.js (Express + TypeScript + Zod)
Database: Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Auth + Storage)
Auth: Supabase Auth + JWT
Email: SMTP (info@maxtechbd.com
)
WhatsApp: Click-to-Chat (Cloud API later)
Real-time: WebSocket (later)
Automation-ready: n8n / Make.com (optional triggers)

📦 Core Modules
1) Auth & Role Management

(Admin / Operational Head / Developer / Client)

2) Lead & Client Management (CRM)
3) Project & Task Management

(Task assignment, checklist, progress, deadline)

4) Internal Team Chat

(Project-wise messaging)

5) File Upload System

(Supabase storage + signed URLs)

6) Staff Attendance System

Check-in / Check-out

Late count

Monthly report

Optional fine rules

Future expansion: Geo-location support

7) Accounts & Finance

Income entries

Expense entries

Category-wise tracking

Total balance = Income – Expense

Monthly/Weekly summaries

Profit/Loss charts

8) Invoice & Payment Tracker

Create invoice

Send invoice via email

Payment status tracking

Due reminders

9) WhatsApp & Email Notification System

(Task assigned → notify developer
Invoice due → reminder
Lead follow-up → automation)

10) Dashboard with KPIs

Leads, Clients, Tasks, Revenue, Expense, Balance, Attendance, etc.

11) Audit Log

(who did what & when)
