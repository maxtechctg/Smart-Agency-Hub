Hi Replit,

I want to upgrade my system to a full Client Communication & Notification Portal so buyers can securely communicate with our assigned developers without accessing any sensitive information.

Here is my complete requirement:

🟦 1. Client Portal – How Buyers Will Use the System

Please implement a proper Client Portal workflow:

Client (Buyer) Should Be Able To:

Login using a client account (created by admin)

See only their own assigned projects (based on clientId)

Open their project and use the built-in chat

Send messages to the assigned developer in real time

Upload files related to the project

See project progress and assigned tasks (read-only)

Change only their own password

Client (Buyer) Must NOT See:

Any other buyers

Any other developers

Any project other than their own

Finance, invoices, payments

Leads, clients list

Team members

Admin data

HR & attendance

Any sensitive information (email, phone, contract details, internal notes)

Chat System Requirements:

Buyer ↔ Assigned Developer only

Admin can view all communication

Each buyer has their own project/chat room

Developer sees only assigned buyers

🟦 2. Notification System (Very Important)

I need a complete notification system for communication between buyers and developers.

A. Email Notifications

Send email automatically when:

Buyer → Developer

Buyer sends a new message

Buyer uploads a file

Buyer sends a new requirement

Developer → Buyer

Developer replies

Developer uploads a file

Developer marks a task as complete

Developer requests approval

B. In-App Real-Time Notifications

Add a Notification Bell (🔔) in the dashboard

Badge counter should show unread notifications

Real-time updates via WebSocket

Clicking the bell shows notification list

C. Database Notification Table

Store:

userId

type

message

projectId

createdAt

read/unread

D. Developer Notification Rules

Developer receives notification only for buyers assigned to them

Developers cannot see other buyers’ notifications

E. Client Notification Rules

Buyer receives notification only for their own project

Buyer should NOT see any internal notifications

🟦 3. Security Rules (Important)

Developers should not see any client contract details, phone, email, payment, or sensitive data

Clients should only see their assigned project

WebSocket must enforce project-specific access

All chat and file actions must validate project ownership

Admin has global access to everything

🟦 4. Deliverables Needed

Client Portal UI

Buyer–Developer private chat system with role restrictions

Real-time in-app notifications via WebSocket

Email notifications for all key events

Notification Bell with unread count

Database notification model

Full security enforcement for clients and developers

Please start building this entire communication + notification system based on my requirements.

Let me know when you begin.
