Hi Replit Team,
I need a complete correction and redesign of ALL system report formats. This includes styling improvements, branding, and export capabilities.

🚨 ISSUE SUMMARY

Across the system, all report outputs have formatting issues:

Invoice PDF looks unprofessional

Profit & Loss PDF layout is broken

Missing branding elements

No consistent margins/spacing

Table alignment problems

Colors don’t match brand identity

Some reports don’t have download options

Example incorrect report:
/mnt/data/5f3e7fdd-c763-47d0-ba12-6ddddf2f96bd.png

📌 REQUIRED FIXES FOR ALL REPORTS

Please update every report (Invoice, Profit & Loss, Financial Reports, Salary Slip, Payroll, Ledger, HR reports, etc.) with the following requirements:

1️⃣ Add Full MaxTech BD Branding to ALL Reports

3️⃣ Add Export Options to ALL Reports

Every report must have:

Download buttons must be visible inside each report page.

This is mandatory for:

Invoice

Payments receipt

4️⃣ NO OTHER MODULE SHOULD BE TOUCHED

Please do NOT change:

Only update report templates, formatting, and export buttons.

🎯 Final Goal

All reports must look clean, branded, and fully professional — suitable for clients, investors, and internal accounting.

Please proceed with these corrections.
Thank you!
