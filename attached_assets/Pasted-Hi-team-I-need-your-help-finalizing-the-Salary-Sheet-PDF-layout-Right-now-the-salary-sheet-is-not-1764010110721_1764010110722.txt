Hi team,

I need your help finalizing the Salary Sheet PDF layout. Right now the salary sheet is not in a standard/payroll-friendly format and several important columns are missing.

1. Current Problems

Layout not standard

The PDF is portrait and leaves a lot of empty white space at the bottom.

Header and body don’t look balanced; it doesn’t feel like a professional payroll report.

Missing important columns

At the moment I only see:
Emp ID, Name, Department, Designation, Basic, Allowances, Deduct, OT, Net Salary.

For a real-life salary sheet I need more detailed breakdowns of earnings and deductions.

Totals / summary area is too basic

Top summary shows only very few totals.

No clear total gross salary, total deductions, or total net payable for the month.

Orientation

For a full salary sheet with many columns, A4 landscape is required.

Right now the design does not use the width properly.

2. What I Want the Salary Sheet to Look Like

Please redesign the Salary Sheet PDF as a professional A4 landscape report with:

(A) Header

Company logo + company name “MaxTech BD”

Address, phone, email.

Title: “Salary Sheet – {Month} {Year}”

Generated date & time.

Optional: small sub-title with branch/office if needed.

(B) Table Columns (per employee)

I need at least the following columns:

Employee Code

Employee Name

Department

Designation

Earnings / Gross:

Basic

House Rent Allowance

Medical Allowance

Conveyance / Transport Allowance

Other Allowances

Gross Salary (sum of all earnings)

Attendance impact:

Present Days

Absent Days

Late Days

Half Days

OT Hours (if overtime is enabled; otherwise show 0.00)

Deductions:

Late / Absence Deduction

Advance / Loan Deduction

Other Deductions

Total Deductions

Final:

Net Payable Salary

You can adjust the exact names/shorten them (e.g. “HRA”, “Med”, “Conv”), but the data should be there.

(C) Totals Row

At the bottom of the table, add a Total row that shows:

Total Basic

Total Gross

Total Deductions

Total Net Payable

for all employees in that month.

(D) Footer / Signatures

At the bottom of the page, add three signature lines:

Prepared By

Verified By

Approved By

And a small footer like:

“MaxTech BD | Smart Agency Control Hub”

3. Behaviour / Data Source (for confirmation)

The data should come from the existing salary generation logic (attendance-driven), so the numbers in the PDF must match the figures in the salary sheet page (Net Salary, Deductions, etc.).

The PDF should fit in a single A4 landscape page for typical staff counts (e.g. 10–20 employees). If more employees, it can continue on the next page but keep the same header and column widths.

Please update the Salary Sheet PDF to follow this specification and make it look like a professional payroll report that I can directly share/print for accounts and audit.
