Hi Replit team,

Thank you for the previous updates. The Salary Sheet PDF layout has improved, but it is still not at a professional HR/payroll standard. I need the following corrections urgently:

🔴 1. Logo Missing

My uploaded MaxTech BD logo is still NOT showing inside the Salary Sheet PDF header.
Please integrate the logo at the top-left of the header.

Logo file path (already uploaded):
/mnt/data/af982e7f-1a51-4434-af9d-1241ae9c2551.png

🔴 2. Header Layout Not Standard

The current header alignment is not symmetrical.
Please fix:

Logo on left

Company name & address block on right

Proper spacing & margin

Consistent typography

Clean horizontal divider below the header

Company details:
MaxTech BD
522, SK Mujib Road (4th Floor), Agrabad, Double Mooring, Chattogram
Phone: +8801843180008
Email: info@maxtechbd.com

🔴 3. Summary Section Still Not Professional

Current summary box spacing is uneven.
Please convert to a 3-column × 2-row grid, like this:

Row 1:

Total Employees

Total Basic Salary

Total Allowances

Row 2:

Total Deductions

Total Overtime

Total Net Payable (highlight with red)

Needs:

Equal width boxes

Proper padding

Balanced spacing

Bordered grid

🔴 4. Table Format Still Not Standard

Problems to fix:

Header row too close to summary section

Column widths not balanced

Status section misaligned

Alternating row shading inconsistent

Text baseline not aligned

“Not Generated” badge overlaps table border

Please update using a clean HR-standard layout.

🔴 5. Signature Section Not Aligned

The signature lines must be:

Same width

Same height

Same spacing

Placed at center bottom

With titles exactly under them
(“Prepared By”, “Verified By”, “Approved By”)

🔴 6. Use MaxTech BD Brand Color Everywhere

Primary color: #E11D26

It must be applied to:

Section titles

Table headers

Summary highlights

Net payable

Status badge (Not Generated = Red)

🔴 7. Final Requirement

The entire Salary Sheet PDF must look like:

A corporate HR report

Clean, balanced, symmetric

With proper margins

With logo

With consistent typography

Please deliver a fully corrected, final professional layout.

I have attached my sample screenshot for reference.
Thank you.
