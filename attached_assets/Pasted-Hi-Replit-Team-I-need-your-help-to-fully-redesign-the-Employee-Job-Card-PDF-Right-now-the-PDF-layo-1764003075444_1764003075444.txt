Hi Replit Team,
I need your help to fully redesign the Employee Job Card PDF. Right now the PDF layout is not professional — alignment, branding, spacing, and formatting all need improvement.

Below are my exact requirements.
Please implement the full redesign exactly as written:

✅ 1. Header Section (Top of PDF)

Please add a full professional header with three sections:

Left Side (Logo)

Place the company logo

Keep proper size and alignment

Add margin from top/left

Center (Company Details)

Add the following text, center aligned:

MAXTECH BD
522, SK Mujib Road (4th Floor), Agrabad, Double Mooring, Chattogram
Phone: +8801843180008
Email: support@maxtechbd.com

Use bold for the company name.

Right Side
Employee Job Card
Period: Oct 25, 2025 – Nov 24, 2025
Generated on: {currentDateTime}

✅ 2. Employee Info Panel

Create a clean, boxed layout showing:

Employee Name

Employee Code

Department

Use proper spacing, border, and left-aligned text.

✅ 3. Attendance Summary (Professional Grid Layout)

Create an 8-item grid (4 columns × 2 rows):

Working Days

Present

On-Time

Late

Half-Day

Absent

Total Hours

Overtime

✔ Values should be bold
✔ Use color coding (green, red, orange, purple)
✔ Add background #f9f9f9 and soft border

✅ 4. Daily Attendance Table (Corporate Style)

Please fix the table:

Add proper table borders

Header row background: #f5f5f5

Date and Day left aligned

Hours right aligned

Status bold

Add row striping (optional)

Columns:

| Date | Day | Check In | Check Out | Status | Hours |

✅ 5. Footer (With Branding)

Add this at bottom, centered:

MaxTech BD | Smart Agency Control Hub
Developed by MaxTech BD IT Team

✅ 6. PDF Formatting Requirements

Page margin: 25px

Font: Inter / Roboto

Proper spacing around sections

Clean alignment

Remove extra white spaces

Make layout consistent and balanced like corporate HR reports

✅ 7. Important

Please ensure the Employee Dropdown also shows:

EMP001 – Monsur
(not “Unknown”)

The job card header already shows the correct name — so only the dropdown text needs fixing.

🎯 Goal

I want the Employee Job Card PDF to look like a professional HR report with complete branding, alignment, and layout.

Please redesign the full PDF according to these requirements.

Thank you.
